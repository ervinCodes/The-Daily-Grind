# The Daily Grind

A site created using Bootstrap and Javascript for a potential client that owns a Cafe business.

## Project Details

The goal of this project to create a unique landing page for a Cafe business that shares it's location, allows customers to browse their menu, choose their items and add to a cart.  If customers are interested, a contact form was also made so they can stay up to date with the client's weekely newsletters.
