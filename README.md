## Overview

### Project Details

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- View cafe contact information and location, allow them to browse their menu, choose items and add to a cart.  
- If interested, there is also a contact form should they like to join a weekly newsletter.

- Bootstrap
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was my very first real project and I learned alot.  I was able to familiarize myself with Bootstrap and it taught me how to tackle a business site project.  I understood the needs and wants of a cafe business and made it accessible to its users by creating an easy to navigate website.  I went in depth with the menu and created a Modal that allows users to add items to a cart.  Lastly, creating this site gave me practice in making a Bootstrap contact form that throws out errors if anything is left blank.

### Continued development

When I revisit this project, I would like to add a checkout page that shows all items in the users cart and create a payment verification so they can purchase the items and have it notify the Cafe.
